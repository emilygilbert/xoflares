code for modeling flares in the framework of @dfm exoplanet code

The [Exoplanet modeling](https://github.com/dfm/exoplanet) stack is super useful for analysing time series data. Some of the stars I'm interested in have flares.
Instead of just trying to cut them out, let's model them!

I used the flare model implemented in [AltaiPony](https://github.com/ekaterinailin/AltaiPony), which is based on 
[appaloosa](https://github.com/jradavenport/appaloosa/). If you use it please cite [Davenport (2016, ApJ)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03494).
